Release notes for Apache Accumulo 1.4.0

Major features added prior to Incubation

 * Tablet merging
 * Efficient deletion of row range
 * Compaction of row range
 * Table cloning
 * FATE : Fault Tolerant Executor. Used to make table operation survive master restart.
 * Concurrent table operation execute correctly
 * Bulk load is now done by master and tablet servers and uses FATE to survive server restarts.
 * Multi-level RFile index
 * Merging minor compactions
 * Logical time for bulk import

Minor features added prior to Incubation
 
 * Monitor will display tablet server and loggers that have died
 * Shell and CloudbaseInputFormat will test extension classes before using them
 * Empty tablet directories will be removed
 * ZooKeeper ACLs prevent accidental disclosure of user passwords
 * Compact and flush can wait for completion
 * Additional test to verify master persistent state and concurrent table operations
 * Added security checks to limit runtime environment of pluggable components
 * Made monitor page display cache info
 * Made file limit configuration less confusing
 * Easily iterate over rows with new row iterator that wraps a scanner
 * New row input format for mapre reduce jobs
 * Execute iterators in a client client side iterator
 * Introduced file archive example
 * Added getMaxRow table operation
 * Replaced Aggregators with Combiners which are iterators
 * Made Filters Iterators
 * New API for configuring iterators
 * Added visibility constraint, it prevents users from writing data they can not read
 * Removed dependency on accumulo-site.xml from client library.
 * Improved tracing granularty
 * Added information about running scans to monitor page

Preformance improvements added prior to incubation
 
 * Cache no longer accesses Namenode when data is in cache.  Now all file names generated by Accumulo are unique over time.
 * No longer use file flage in HDFS, reducing pressure on Namenode.
 * Shorter tablet dir names, saves namenode memory.
 * Logger can write to multiple drives.
